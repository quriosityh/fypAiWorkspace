Analysis Phase Use Case Diagram
An analysis-level use case diagram is a more detailed version of the high-level use case
diagram. It explains how each high-level use case will be carried out in the system by
breaking it down into smaller, more specific actions or interactions. This helps in
understanding the internal structure of each high-level functionality.
Two special relationships are commonly used in this diagram to represent connections
between use cases:

 Include: Used when a common sub-function is shared by multiple use cases.

 Extend: Used when a use case adds optional behavior to another use case.
This diagram plays a key role in requirement analysis and helps in designing a system that
meets all functional needs clearly.

 Requirement Specification & Design
Domain Model
The domain model represents the system from a conceptual perspective, showing the key
entities (or conceptual classes) and their relationships. These classes are typically derived
from the nouns found in high-level use cases.
The domain model includes:

 Conceptual Classes with meaningful names and relevant attributes

 Associations that depict relationships between the classes
This model helps in understanding the system’s structure before moving into detailed
design. It serves as a bridge between requirement analysis and object-oriented design.

Sequence Diagrams for Each High-Level Use Case
A Sequence diagram illustrates the sequence of interactions between objects (or
components) in a system. It focuses on the order of method invocations and the flow of
messages between objects, showing the dynamic behaviour of a system over time.
These diagrams are particularly useful for detailing how different objects collaborate to fulfill
a specific use case in a system, especially when you need to capture the order in which
operations or messages occur.
Key points:

 A Sequence diagram represents the interactions between objects or components.

 The objects involved are displayed as vertical lines, while the interactions (method calls,
messages) are shown as horizontal arrows between these lines.

 The timeline is depicted as time progresses vertically.

 Sequence diagrams are created by identifying the high-level use cases and then
determining the sequence of operations between identified classes or objects in those
use cases.

 These diagrams are critical for understanding how objects communicate and interact in
response to specific events or actions, especially in real-time systems.
Example Process for Creation:
1. Identify the high-level use case.
2. Determine the key objects or components involved.
3. Establish the interactions between these objects in terms of method invocations or
messages.
4. Depict the order of these interactions using a timeline.

 Requirement Specification & Design
Data Model using Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) – Database
Design
The Data Model is a part of the implementation model that describes how data will be stored,
organized, and related within the system. It helps in understanding the structure of the
database before actual implementation.
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) visually represents the data and its relationships
using standard symbols and notations. This diagram is essential for designing the logical
structure of the database.
The key elements of an ERD include:

 Entities: Represent real-world objects or concepts (e.g., Student, Book, Order) stored
in tables.

 Relationships: Represent how entities are related to each other (e.g., A Student
borrows a Book).

 Cardinality: Indicates the number of instances in one entity that can be associated with
instances in another entity (e.g., One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).

 Modality (or Participation): Indicates whether the relationship is mandatory or optional
for the participating entities.
A well-designed ERD ensures data integrity and supports efficient data retrieval and storage.
You can use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or MySQL Workbench to draw the ERD.

[Final Year Project Title]
 Requirement Specification & Design
The Design Class Diagram is developed using case model, domain model, and sequence
diagrams. It provides a detailed view of the system's structure by showing how classes
interact and relate at a design level.
The key elements of a Design Class Diagram include:

 Classes, their attributes, and associations

 Interfaces with their defined operations

 Methods implemented by classes

 Navigability between classes (which class knows about the other)

 Dependencies among classes
It is essential to use appropriate class relationships, such as:

 Inheritance (generalization)

 Containment (composition and aggregation)

 Dependencies (use or collaboration relationships)
Where relevant, design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc., can be applied to
make the design robust and reusable.
